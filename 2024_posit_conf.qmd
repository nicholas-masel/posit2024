What's Out There & Why You Should Join

<!-- DON'T SAY THIS, BUT THIS IS BASICALLY IT - START -->

<!-- My experience turning 40 and needing to go to the gym is alot like my open-source journey. I knew I needed to make a change, but I didn't know how to go about doing it. -->

<!-- DON'T SAY THIS, BUT THIS IS BASICALLY IT - END -->

I recently turned 40

and this is the age where I hear from people with experience saying things like,

I tweaked my back, getting out of the car or

no, I can't eat that, it has too much cholesterol.

So now that I've joined this group, I set an appointment for a check-up with my doctor.

When I showed up, I found that I have white-coat syndrome.

And that means every time I think about my BP, it goes up!

<!-- No, these aren’t my actual numbers,  -->

<!-- but it makes for nice plot. -->

So the next day, I’m chatting about this with some friends

and one of my buddies insists I go to the gym with him,

he’ll pick me up at 5 am!

He says it very casually, like it’s a normal time to be awake and to be working out.

But I’ve got to do something, so I agree.

5 am comes quickly,

I jump in his truck and we’re off.

Now, I’ve never worked out in a gym in my life, so I don’t know what to expect.

We open the door and this was my experience. SHOW CRAZY VIDEO

<!-- I can’t turn around and leave, since I rode with a friend,  -->

<!-- so continue on, and try to not seem too out of place. -->

And when I think about this now,

it's a really close parallel to my open-source journey.

-   How I found a need to make a change,

-   How not making a change would be detrimental to myself and those around me.

-   How terrifying it was to start something new.

Now I'd like to share my open-source journey with you!

-   In hopes that it will help you along your journey.

And to do that, I've lumped that journey into three buckets

THINK ORGANIZATIONALLY:

-   About how your COMPANY can improve, by adopting open-source.

BELIEVE:

-   And I want you to believe, you have the ability to drive the use of open-source w/in your org.

HOW DID WE ACHIEVE THIS:

-   Interactivity is the Key

-   Find some quick wins

-   "Borrow code"

So what were the benefits?

-   Easier to use.

-   Reduced errors (copy/paste and accidental modifications).

-   Faster and higher quality.

-   Saving \$250k/year!

SALARY SAVED:

-   That's more than I make a year.
-   So, not too bad for a few weeks of work!

SHOW VALUE, QUICKLY:

-   We were able to show value, quickly

-   and pose the question

QUESTIONS:

-   What if we have two people doing this?

-   What about three?

-   What can we achieve if we invest resources here?

::: notes
So, how did we build our house.

GENERAL CONTRACTOR:

-   If you know nothing about building a house.

-   Having a general contractor is important.

ROLES:

They understand you need a:

-   plumber,
-   electrician,
-   painter, etc.

ORDER & LANGUAGE OF THE TRADE:

-   They understand the order things need to occur.

-   They understand the language of each trade.

-   Communicating effectively across the roles.

MODERNIZATION OF STATISTICAL ANALYTICS

-   The modernization of statistical analysis working group plays this role as a general contractor.

-   Now there not going to build your house for you,

-   but they can teach you what roles need to be involved,

-   the language of each trade,

-   so you can effectively drive the building of your home.

SUB-CONTRACTORS:

GENERAL CONTRACTORS ARE NOT PLUMBERS:

-   General contractors aren't plumbers, they aren't electricians.

-   But they know a lot of them,

-   And they know who does good work!

SELECTING SOFTWARE:

-   And this is how you can think about selecting software,
-   And the R Validation Hub, which is a working group w/in the R Consortium, is leading the way here.
-   When you pick an electrician,
-   You want one who is going to check that
-   the light they installed, turns on when you flip the switch.

R VALIDATION HUB:

-   The R Validation Hub will guide you in how to pick the right software...
-   And how to document that, correctly.

THE HOUSE IS BUILT! LET'S MOVE IN:

-   No, we need to make sure it's safe
-   And it's effective at being a house.
-   Little bit of a stretch there, but we'll make it work :)

REGULATORY AGENCIES:

-   This is no different than us submitting to regulatory agencies.
-   And the R Consortium has another working group, around submissions,
-   To guide you in correctly submitting to agencies,
-   While using open-source.

TRANSITION:

-   And this is how we built our house.\
-   We leaned on the open-source community,\
-   We joined open-source initiatives,
-   We learned from the industry, to overcome challenges.

WHY WE BUILT A NEW HOUSE IN THE FIRST PLACE:

-   You already had a house.
-   We need to get treatments to patient in need faster.

No surprise, standards are key to improving efficiency.

PHARMAVERSE:

-   group of people, working to curate packages, specific to pharma
-   aim to standarize the set of packages regulatory reviewers receive
-   reviewers see different, and even proprietary packages each review, opposite of our goal to speed things up
-   reviewers continue to see the same set of packages, build trust in packages
-   this will help us save time

TRANSITION:

-   Going past packages, if we go another step foward
-   Worry less about how results are formatted on a page, and more about results NEXT SLIDE

CARDINAL:

-   "table-generating functions to implement standard FDA Safety Tables"
-   Reuse code to generate results at an industry level (where you can)

TRANSITION:

-   So, standards can bring efficiencies.
-   Interactivity can too. NEXT SLIDE

INTERACTIVITY:

-   Interactive frameworks, like teal, rhino, and golem, provide a standard way to give interactivity to your stakeholders.
-   This, allows them to answer questions in real time.
-   Helping to more quickly understand and summarize their findings.
